# About linux
`Linus Torvalds` the man who makes all open source . He is the person creates `linux kernel` to allow anyone use of it.
Based on the linux  kernel now that evolve as many linux `Distributions`,for differnt uses.
**He implement this based on `UNIX ENVIRONMENTS`**.
### some Distributions :
 * Debian based => Kali linux,ubuntu,parrot
 * Arch linux
 * Redhat linux
# Booting process
 __the booting process involves four steps__:point_down:
#### **BIOS (POST)**
  + when we switch on the computer . BIOS(Basic Input/Output System) is the first program to start your system.It invokes the POST(Power On Self Test) which needs to check all the hardware properites are connected successfully or not. If any problem in hardware it sound like beep:saxophone:  
#### Boot loader(MBR)
  * Next step is load boot loader . MBR(Master Boot Redcord) is the boot loader located on the first 512 bytes in a disk.
    The main goal of boot loader is to run kernel into main memory.:minidisc:
#### Kernel initializatioin
 + Kernel is heart of the operating system . when MBR locates kernel and initialize into main memory . In this stage your system ready to run.  kernel now runs all services.:abacus:
#### Systemd 
  + After the kernel init . The init is the first process to run when kernel loads . Systemd managees all process and services to run .
  + This also select desktop environment.:computer:

# Linux Filesystem
   ***In a linux all files under / or Root directory***
   + Linux follow File Hierarchy Structure . All files under / directory
#### Important Directory
   + `/boot` directory stores all files that helps to boot a system
   +  `/bin`  diretory stores all binary files to start or load system
   +  `/sbin` directory stores all system binary files for super user
   +  `/opt` directory stores all options programs you installed
   +  `/proc` all running process
   +  `/home` this directory for users
   +  `/lib` all shared library files for system programs
   +  `/dev` device nodes
   +  `/etc` It is the second largest Directory in a file system . this stores all configuration files of programs,services and users.
   + `/media or /mnt ` media and  mounted file systems
   + `/tmp` stores all temporary files
   + `/usr` It is the largest Directory in a file system. It contain all programs and files supported to user.
          * `/usr/bin` it stores all executable binary programs installed by user
           * `/use/sbin/` all binary executable files to use for super user
   + `/var`/ stores all log information
